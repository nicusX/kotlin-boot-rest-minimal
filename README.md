# SpringBoot - Kotlin - REST minimalistic example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicusX/kotlin-boot-rest-minimal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicusX/kotlin-boot-rest-minimal)

This is a very simple example of SpringBoot application exposing a REST API, written in Kotlin and including simple testing.

The code is not particularly smart: all blocking, endpoints are generated with a `@Controller` rather than the
new WebFlux API...

For educational purposes only.
