# SpringBoot - Kotlin - REST minimalistic example

This is a very simple example of SpringBoot application exposing a REST API, written in Kotlin and including simple testing.

The code is not particularly smart: all blocking, endpoints are generated with a `@Controller` rather than the
new WebFlux API...
